# AdvanceCSSProject2

## My Task

This weeks challenge was for me to create a portfolio page that will showcase my future projects in a full stack webdelopment boot camp. 

I do not have any current deployed projects I linked to my previous homework. 

I used various techniques and incuded flex-boxes and a media res.
